# Valtor-Rover-Code-2023

This repository contains the Arduino codes primarily written by me for Valtor as part of the 2023 EEE Year 1 Summer Design Project.

The code includes various functionalities for controlling the rover, including motor control, sensor integration, and basic obstacle avoidance. Additionally, a simple web server was implemented to allow remote monitoring and control of the rover via a web interface.

## Features

- Motor control for movement
- Sensor integration for obstacle detection
- Basic obstacle avoidance algorithm
- Simple web server for remote control and monitoring

## Project Report

For a detailed overview of the project, including design decisions, implementation details, and results, please refer to the [full project report](Valtor - Samuel Khoo-compressed.pdf) available in this repository.
